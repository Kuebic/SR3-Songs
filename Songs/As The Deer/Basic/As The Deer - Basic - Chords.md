VERSE 1
[D]As the [A]deer panteth [Bm]for the [F#m]water
So my [G]soul longeth [A]after [D]thee    [A]
[D]You a[A]lone are my [Bm]heart’s de[F#m]sire
And I [G]long to [A]worship [D]thee

CHORUS
[Bm]You a[Bm7]lone are my [G]strength my [D]shield
To [G]you alone may my [Em]spirit [F#m]yield
[D]You a[A]lone are my [Bm]heart’s de[F#m]sire
And I [G]long to [A]worship [D]thee

VERSE 2
You’re my friend and you are my brother 
even though you are a king
I love you more than any other 
so much more than anything

CHORUS

VERSE 3
I need you more than gold or silver 
only you can satisfy
You alone are the real joy giver 
and the apple of my eye

CHORUS

OUTRO
And I [G]long to [A]worship [Bm]thee
And I [G]long to [A]worship [D]thee
